                1) Difference between localstorage and session storage ?
            </h1>
            <p>
                The one major difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is the expiration date...
                <br> <br>
                <strong class="red">localStorage</strong> persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the
                domain is opened in a new tab, or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no
                expiration.
                <br> <br>
                <strong class="red">sessionStorage</strong> is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts
                as long as the tab or the
                browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session and new
                storage.

                2) Difference between global scope and block scope in javascript?
            </h1>
            <p>
                <strong class="blue">Global Scope</strong>
                <br>
                The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have
                global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
                function or conditional state can access that variable.
                <br><br>
                <strong class="blue">Block Scope</strong>
                <br>
                The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional
                statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly
                brackets {}.
                <br>
                The keywords let and const are used to define block variables
