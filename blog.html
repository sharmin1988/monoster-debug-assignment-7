               1) Difference between localstorage and session storage ?
            </h1>
            <p>
                The one major difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is the expiration date...
                <br> <br>
                <strong class="red">localStorage</strong> persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the domain is opened in a new tab, or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration.
                <br> <br>
                <strong class="red">sessionStorage</strong> is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab or the
                browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session and new
                storage.
