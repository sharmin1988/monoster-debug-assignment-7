                1) Difference between localstorage and session storage ?
            </h1>
            <p>
                The one major difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is the expiration date...
                <br> <br>
                <strong class="red">localStorage</strong> persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the
                domain is opened in a new tab, or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no
                expiration.
                <br> <br>
                <strong class="red">sessionStorage</strong> is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts
                as long as the tab or the
                browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session and new
                storage.

                2) Difference between global scope and block scope in javascript?
            </h1>
            <p>
                <strong class="blue">Global Scope</strong>
                <br>
                The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have
                global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
                function or conditional state can access that variable.
                <br><br>
                <strong class="blue">Block Scope</strong>
                <br>
                The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional
                statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly
                brackets {}.
                <br>
                The keywords let and const are used to define block variables

                3) How event loop work in javascript?
            </h1>
            <p>
                An <strong>event loop</strong> is a programming construct that allows a program to handle multiple
                events or tasks simultaneously.
                <br>
                Though JS executes all operations on a single thread,The event loop allows JavaScript to perform
                non-blocking, multiple operations. When an asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start
                running. <strong>Letâ€™s take a look how event loop works</strong> ....
                <br><br>
                In JS, the call stack keeps track of all the operations in line to be executed.The event queue is
                responsible for sending new functions to the call stack for processing.
                <br>
                But whenever an async function is called, Then JavaScript engine place the function into a queue called
                a callback queue or a task queue.
                <br>
                The event loop is a constantly running process that coordinates the tasks between the call stack and callback queue to achieve concurrency.
                If the call stack is not empty, the event loop waits until it is empty and places the next function from
                the callback queue to the call stack. If the callback queue is empty, nothing will happen.

                4) How many types of undefined we will get during work in javascript?
            </h1>
            <p>
                We can get <strong class="red">undefined</strong> from several ways, they are ......
            <ul>
                <li>Variables that are not initialized will give undefined</li>
                <li>Function with no returns</li>
                <li> During the function call, if the parameter does not send to the function.</li>
                <li>when return (in a function body) is not defined what to return!!. will give undefined</li>
                <li>Try to access a property from an object body that (property) does not exist.</li>
                <li>Try to get index of an array, outside the array length (which is decleared) will give undefined</li>
            </ul>
